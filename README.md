# Hello World

## Overview

This is my first attempt at creating a simple, cross-platform GUI application using Python and PyQt5, packaged with pyinstaller, and automatically built with Github Actions. 

## Releases

The following operating systems are supported:

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

NOTE: For Linux you'll likely have to set the file to be executable, before trying to run it.

Example (for v1.0):

```
chmod +x hello_world_v1.0_linux
```

See the [releases](https://github.com/warelock2/hello_world/releases) section for OS-specific, compiled binaries to download and directly run.
