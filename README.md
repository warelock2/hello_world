# Hello World

This is my first attempt at creating a simple, cross-platform GUI application using Python and PyQt5, packaged with pyinstaller. The following operating systems are supported:

- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows

See the [releases](https://github.com/warelock2/hello_world/releases) section for OS-specific, compiled binaries to download and directly run.
